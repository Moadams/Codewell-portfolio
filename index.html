          A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities
        </h3>
        <p class="about-description">
          The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500
          companies has allowed me to developer a skillset that helps me in not
          just development, but in every aspect of any business.

          <br />
          <br />
          I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's
          largest communities teaching young minds about how to sell yourself as
          a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.

          As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's
          holding you back is yourself.
          <br /><br />
          A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.
          <br /><br />
          "How big would you dream, if you <b>knew</b> you wouldn't fail?"
          You've already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's
          time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're
          passionate about. <br /><br />
          I'm happy to chat over coffee sometime about how I can help your
          company.
